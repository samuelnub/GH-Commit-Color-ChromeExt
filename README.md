# GitHub Commit Color Changer - Chrome Extension

![a really bad gif](https://i.gyazo.com/7bd95e24339fcb935da794937183ea50.gif)

This is by far, one of; if not _the_ most useless browser extension around.

####Although I don't advocate that you yourself get this extension, here are some key features:
- It does the job
- It works
- It syncs and will retain your set colors across Chrome instances
- It is not going to spill your ice cream (if it does, please don't hold me liable)
- If you're a real British person like me, and you dislike the use of "Color" in the popup menu's title, show your displeasure by furiously clicking the title, and it will become several orders of magnitude better

####So why shouldn't you get this?
- I'm assuming this thing is horribly inefficient
- I was not experienced with JavaScript when I started this, and I still am not
- Not only am I unskilled in JS, but I am also hopeless in programming and problem solving in general
- There's a lot of bugs that I can already forsee and can already experience, but I don't know if I'll ever fix them
- It looks like a very unappealing bundle of several-week-old asparagus
- It doesn't work first time if you haven't visited a user's GitHub profile page yet
- Doesn't change the flex bars below; those that show the commit ratios per month
- You only have the option of adjusting RGB value sliders; what is this, 1998?

####You've somehow made it this far without clicking somewhere else; never to see this again. That's pretty impressive
Congratulations, me. I've managed to retain your attention for a considerable amount of time; more than I had originally planned for. This is excellent. So, **"how do you build/run this?"** might be a question that may befuddle your mind. Well, if you're here, I assume you have some knowledge on how to clone a repo. That's good. Now, you may want to go to your Chrome menu, go to settings; then extensions, and then see that little "developer mode" check box? Yeah, the one that you're probably already using. Yea, tick that. If it was already ticked prior to this instruction, turn it off, becasue you need to take a break every once in a while, you know? If it wasnt enabled, enable it. I'm not forcing you, just a recommendation if you want to follow this short guide properly. After which, place your mouse cursor ever-so-gently on the "load unpacked extension" button, and click it. Be careful not to agitate the button before clicking it. My mother lost one of her fingers due to this careless rookie mishap. Sorry, I don't want to get too personal here, this is meant to be a profesisonal presentation and guide, greatest apologies. So, proceeding this, a file explorer menu should appear, and you should be able to point to the directory of this cloned repository; the folder containing the "manifest.json" file. You may then want to select "cancel", as this was an abysmal idea which should not have followed through for such a prolonged period of time.
